Boolean Values:
While the integer, floating-point, and string data types have an unlimited
number of possible values, the Boolean data type has only two values: True
and False. (Boolean is capitalized because the data type is named after
mathematician George Boole.) When entered as Python code, the Boolean
values True and False lack the quotes you place around strings, and they
always start with a capital T or F, with the rest of the word in lowercase.
Enter the following into the interactive shell. (Some of these instructions
are intentionally incorrect, and they’ll cause error messages to appear.)


THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE == AND = OPERATORS
You might have noticed that the == operator (equal to) has two equal signs,
while the = operator (assignment) has just one equal sign. It’s easy to confuse
these two operators with each other. Just remember these points:
• The == operator (equal to) asks whether two values are the same as
each other.
• The = operator (assignment) puts the value on the right into the variable
on the left.
To help remember which is which, notice that the == operator (equal to)
consists of two characters, just like the != operator (not equal to) consists of
two characters.
